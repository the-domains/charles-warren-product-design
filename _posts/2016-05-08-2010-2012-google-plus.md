# 2009-2012 Google+

In 2010, Facebook's growth made it not just a threat to companies like Google, but to the entire Internet.

Google's leadership was rightly concerned, and tapped a small team to develop a strategy, and release a candidate internally in 100 days. I led the UX team for this effort, as well as for the much larger effort to build and launch the product in the summer of 2010\.
