# How to hire me to run your one-week design sprint.

I'm extremely experienced in running successful design sprints for product companies. 

_Charles led us to a vision for our MVP in less than five days. _Miko Matsumura, CMO, Gradle

_Charles brought a loosely formed pile of ideas into sharp enough focus that we could roll up our sleeves and get to work with confidence.___

From sprints to create reality shows, to baby delivery, to bathroom tissue, I've helped teams converge on exactly who their product is for, what it does, and most importantly, what it means.

## Planning starts three weeks out minimum

We're going to need three weeks to get organized for the one-week sprint. Plus I'll work the week after to sew up the deliverables and the findings into something you can take action on. 

Three weeks isn't long: we need to figure out the participants (fewer than 10), make materials, recruit customers for the Friday feedback session, and organize the venue and materials.

# The decider must be present all week

If you're contemplating running a design sprint, and you're not the CEO/Head of product/visionary in your organization, the first thing you need to do is convince that person they need to be present for the entire effort. Don't get in touch with me before you have that commitment. I don't have the time or the inclination to help you with that, unless you want me to pay me for the time, which you shouldn't.

# Your product, your team, all on the same page in less than a month

If we follow the process, we'll get good results. You'll be months ahead on your roadmap, your team will be in alignment, and you'll have a detailed and concrete project plan you can get started on right away.
