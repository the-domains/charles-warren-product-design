I was engaged by Gradle for a short project to help develop a SaaS product design for the company. In a week we developed the product, prototyped it, and put it in front of several users for feedback.

Based on the strength of the feedback, I saw an opportunity to join the company as its Chief Product Officer. I led the team through the first release of the SaaS, and subsequent Series A fundraising round.
