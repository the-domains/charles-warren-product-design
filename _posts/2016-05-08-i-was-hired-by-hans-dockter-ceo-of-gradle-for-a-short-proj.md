I joined Gradle as its Chief Product Officer in April 2015\. I led the design of its SaaS product, which we released in November. I left the company in May of 2016\.

I built a world-class design and front-end engineering team, led the team through the first release of the SaaS, and finally, I helped pitch the Series A fundraising round.
