My work experience at Google had two phases: the Mobile era and the Social Era.

I joined Google's mobile team in 2007 just prior to the launch of the iPhone. I worked on the existing suite of mobile products that ran in early browsers on Nokia and Palm devices. Once the iPhone launched, and Google responded with Android, our world changed. Mobile suddenly became the future, and the number of users we were supporting began to grow quickly.

One trend we noticed was that mobile data was being taken up much more quickly in China, India, and Sub-Saharan Africa. I was tasked with figuring out why. I assembled a team of designers, researchers, product managers and engineers, and we spent over a year directly observing users in these regions, prototyping and ultimately launching mobile products specific to each geography. It was an exciting and eye-opening time.

Back in Mountain View in 2008, I am given the role of managing the mobile team, and I lead a design effort to quickly move Google's search advertising product onto mobile devices. After trying and failing with dozens of prototypes, we finally landed on a format that was both engaging, and fraud resistant. In just under 18 months, mobile search ads went from zero to $1 billion in revenue. For the growth of mobile Adwords, I received an, Organizing Committee(OC) award, one of the most valued forms of recognition at the company.

It is now 2010 and Facebook is on the march. The social era begins. A few of us form a small team to work out a plan to compete. I lead the product design effort along with an extremely talented group of designers and researchers hand-picked by me. We launch an internal prototype of a social feed in 100 days. The internal reception is terrible. The team presses on, and in less than a year, we launch a credible competitor to Facebook in the form of Google+

I'm proud of the design work in the product, particularly its Photos and Hangouts features, but the hype is almost impossible to overcome, and soon after launch, the press begins to predict Google+'s demise.

Having grown the design team to over 60 people, I'm itching to get back to project work. My last project at Google was called "Carousel," a product that launches about a year later called, "Google Stories:" It offers a better way to make use of the hundreds of photos and videos users upload every week, and cut down on the drudgery of editing and processing all that material.
