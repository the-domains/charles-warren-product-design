My work at IDEO was about becoming a better designer. I was hired on the strength of my design facilitation skills: I had run dozens of "Deep Dive," style projects for clients at Scient, (now Razorfish), and that kind of work was becoming a mainstay at IDEO.

I was also a little burned out on technology. In 2001, they hype and promise wasn't matching reality. I immersed myself in a long list of non-technological service design projects: for Kaiser Permanente's pregnancy and childbirth organization, and for ABC TV's reality programming division, for example.

While I worked on these projects, I made major contributions to IDEO's service offering: bringing the now famous, "How might we..." process into practice, as well as experimenting with new collaborative formats, including designing and leading the largest workshop at IDEO before or since.

But by the second part of the decade, fast advancements in Mobile reignited my enthusiasm for the promise of technology. I spent my final year at IDEO working with Nokia on an ambitious set of cloud services, a year before the iPhone was announced.
