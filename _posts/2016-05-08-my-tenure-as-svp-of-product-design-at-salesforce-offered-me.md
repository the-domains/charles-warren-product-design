My Tenure as SVP of product design at Salesforce offered me two new challenges: How to lead a large design team that had drifted due to changing interim leadership for over two years, and second, how to help Salesforce embrace the mobile sales future in its products it was promoting in its marketing messages.

I found a team with incredible talent: from leadership through to individual contributors, but with little cohesion, shared values, or agreed work processes.

# 2013-2014: Salesforce Product Design team SVP

The UX leadership team and I set about righting the ship: we began an ambitious project to make Salesforce mobile once-and-for-all called "Salesforce1", we hired a new layer of experienced UX leaders who began to shape the various product teams into functional collaborative units. We worked hard to unify and update Salesforce's famously outdated visual design: One research subject said, "the 90's called and it wants its UI back." during a feedback session.

To strengthen trust and the culture, we put proper role definitions, career trajectories, and performance evaluation processes in-place. We met weekly to share successes and work on issues. We set up regular critiques and research reviews to bring up the quality of the design work. We met with the entire product leadership team every month to review the product strategy. The team started coming together in an inspiring way.

We tracked team satisfaction, and we were able to move it significantly in my 18 month tenure. The one metric we could not change however, was the pace of product delivery at Salesforce. 

Its three-release-per-year cadence made it difficult for product teams to release-and-test with reasonable speed. This was the one systemic factor that made it difficult to retain ambitious design talent, and has yet to be resolved to this day.

After nearly two years of hands-off executive leadership however, I wanted to roll up my sleeves again and make something from scratch...
